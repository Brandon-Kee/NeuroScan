# ðŸ§  NeuroScan
NeuroScan is a deep learningâ€“based computer vision application designed to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans using MobileNetV3Large and transfer learning. Built with Streamlit and TensorFlow, it provides a user-friendly interface for medical professionals and researchers to quickly assess potential abnormalities.The model is trained to distinguish among four distinct classes:

- Pituitary Tumors

- Glioma Tumors

- Meningioma Tumors
  
- No Tumor
## Project Background
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain or its surrounding structures, which can be either **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous). They are classified into several types based on their origin and behavior, with the most common primary brain tumors including **gliomas** (arising from glial cells, often aggressive), **meningiomas** (typically benign, forming in the meninges), and **pituitary adenomas** (developing in the pituitary gland). Early and accurate detection is critical, as tumors can cause neurological deficits, seizures, or life-threatening complications depending on their size and location. Traditional diagnosis relies on MRI or CT scans analyzed by radiologists, but manual interpretation can be time-consuming and subjective. 

NeuroScan addresses these challenges by leveraging deep learning to **automate brain tumor classification**, providing rapid, standardized assessments of MRI scans. By distinguishing between tumor types and non-tumor cases with high accuracy, this system aids clinicians in **prioritizing urgent cases, reducing diagnostic delays, and improving patient outcomes**. The tool is particularly valuable in resource-limited settings where access to specialized neuroradiologists is scarce.

### Technologies Used

4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

## Data & Preprocessing
The data for this project was sourced from the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle.
### Image Augmentation
Image augmentation was used to improve model genralization while preserving critical diagnostic features in the MRI scans. The methods used for image augmentation include:

**1. Brightness Adjustment** -> Randomly increases or decreases the image brightness by Â±20%.
   
   &emsp; Purpose: Mimics variations in scanner intensity and lighting conditions.
   
**2. Contrast Enhancement** -> Randomly adjusts the contrast, making details either more or less prominent.
   
   &emsp; Purpose: Helps the model learn to detect tumors even when the tumor region isn't sharply defined.

## Training the Model
### Training Parameters
* **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.0001)
* Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
* Batch Size: 20
* Epochs: 50
* Fine-Tuning: Last 20 layers unfrozen

The training parameters were carefully selected to balance model performance and computational efficiency while leveraging transfer learning. The Adam optimizer with a low learning rate (0.0001) was chosen to enable stable fine-tuning of the pretrained MobileNetV3Large base modelâ€”this conservative rate prevents drastic overwriting of the pretrained weights while still allowing meaningful updates to the unfrozen layers. Sparse categorical crossentropy was selected as the loss function because it efficiently handles multi-class classification (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor) without requiring one-hot encoded labels. A batch size of 20 provides a compromise between memory constraints (critical for high-resolution 224Ã—224 MRI images) and gradient stability during training. The model was trained for 50 epochs to ensure full convergence. Only the last 20 layers were unfrozen to preserve the base modelâ€™s early-layer feature detectors (while specializing the deeper layers for MRI image features. Together, these parameters optimize the trade-off between retaining transfer learning benefits and adapting to brain tumor detection.

### Why Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging where:

- Labelled data is limited.
- Training deep CNNs from scratch is computationally expensive.
- Pretrained models can generalize well with minimal fine-tuning.

MobileNetV3Large, trained on millions of images, already understands basic visual features (edges, textures, shapes). By freezing these layers, the model adapts quickly to specialized medical data.
