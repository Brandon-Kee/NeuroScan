# ðŸ§  NeuroScan
NeuroScan is a deep learningâ€“based computer vision application designed to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans using MobileNetV3Large and transfer learning. Built with Streamlit and TensorFlow, it provides a user-friendly interface for medical professionals and researchers to quickly assess potential abnormalities.The model is trained to distinguish among four distinct classes:


- Pituitary Tumors

- Glioma Tumors

- Meningioma Tumors
  
- No Tumor
## Project Background

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

## Data & Preprocessing
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Training the Model


### Why Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging where:

- Labelled data is limited.
- Training deep CNNs from scratch is computationally expensive.
- Pretrained models can generalize well with minimal fine-tuning.

MobileNetV3Large, trained on millions of images, already understands basic visual features (edges, textures, shapes). By freezing these layers, the model adapts quickly to specialized medical data.
